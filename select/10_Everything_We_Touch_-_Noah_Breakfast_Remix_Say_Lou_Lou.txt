I lived inside the hidden bay and time used to pass so slow
I raised dragons by my side, but I had to let them go
(I feel like we're running wild and we gotta let it grow
And these days you're by my side, but I had to let you know)

Days of ashes and nights of flames
A taste for beauty and thirst for games
Do you need to see my soul?
Just let me know when you get high

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost in the machine and there's a glowing light

Now there's a black spot on the sun, I can't make it go away
I spent lightyears wasting my time until I knew your name

Days of ashes and nights of flames
A taste for beauty and thirst for games
Do you need to see my soul?
Just let me know when you get high

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost in the machine and there's a glowing light

When you get out
In the dark we make it special make it justified

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost in the machine and there's a glowing light
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost in the machine and there's a glowing light
